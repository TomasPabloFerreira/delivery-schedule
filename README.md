## This projet is a challenge created by the youtube channel [Hola Mundo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aouDQ8caJYg&t=224s).

#### The challange is the following:

Build a list that contains time slots, in 30-minute intervals, starting at 8am and ending at 8pm.

- The company has an availability of 8 motorcyclists every 30 minutes.
- When you click, you must take a motorcycle resource, and mark the box in green.
- If the same user clicks, the resource must be released.
- If other users took all the motorcyclists, the box will appear in red.

I decided to do it with variable data (time ranges, days and intervals duration), obtained from a (simulated) server.

It took me about 2 hours to develop this.
